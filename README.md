## What I am up to
I have just recently released my first Android Application on Google Play. The apps name is YANA and you can find the source code here: https://github.com/CodeyArch/YANA

You can also get the app on Google Play here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.goobydev.composenotes


My next main project will be creating my own Irl RPG Android application using similar technologies as my current project in Android Studio. The idea behind this application is to encourage real life self care through in-app rewards by having users complete tasks regularly for experience and points.
